                <h2>Fly by Night</h2>
                <p>Fly by Night was recorded at Toronto Sound Studios on Overlea Boulevard in Toronto, where they recorded parts of their first album as well as their next two albums, Caress of Steel and 2112. John Rutsey left the band, and with one week's notice, Neil Peart joined the band for Rush's first American tour. In addition to drumming duties, Neil also took on the job of lyricist, leading the band to adopt a more literary lyrical style that differed significantly from their self-titled debut album.</p>

                <h2>Rush</h2>
                <p>The album that started it all. Original drummer John Rutsey performed all drum parts on the album. The recording sessions were produced by Dave Stock at Eastern Sound in Toronto, recorded late at night because the studio rates were the cheapest (they recorded the album on their own dime). The band was unhappy with the quality of the first sessions, so they moved to Toronto Sound Studios and produced the next sessions themselves to get a better sound.</p>

                <h2>2112</h2>
                <p>The band's label didn't want Rush to do another “concept” album. The band ignored this advice and went on to record their first major commercial success and a signature record, which enabled them to chart their own course moving forward. Writing the material took about six months, and the album, recorded at Toronto Sound with Terry Brown, required about a month in the studio to finish.</p>
